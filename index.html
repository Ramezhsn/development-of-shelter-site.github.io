      <h2>Collaborative Development of Guidance Document:</h2>
      <p>Initial Meeting (November 14, 2023): A meeting at the Grand Serail National Operations Room brought together representatives from the LDR DRR Unit, WHO, UNICEF, NRC, IOM, UNDP, and the DRR Unit and DM sector. This collaborative effort focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining the Scope: Establishing the outline for the guidance document to address various aspects of shelter management.</li>
        <li>Incorporating Sector-Specific Expertise: Representatives from different agencies provided valuable insights to ensure the document covers all relevant aspects.</li>
        <li>Highlighting Preparedness Measures: LRC representatives emphasized the importance of integrating shelter preparedness measures, including first aid and firefighting training, essential equipment provision, and evacuation plan development.</li>
        <li>Leveraging Existing Resources: LRC showcased their existing shelter management training program and the availability of trainers.</li>
        <li>Standardization Efforts: A follow-up meeting with LRC and IOM was planned to establish a standardized template for all parties involved.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Standardized Template Development (November 16, 2023):</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing a Framework: A preliminary framework for the document was created, outlining the key chapters.</li>
        <li>Assigning Responsibilities: The LRC DRR Unit will lead the development of the Safety and Security chapter, while the DM sector team will work with IOM on other chapters and the rest of the chapters will be developed by the relevant sectors.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Parallel Efforts: Training Needs Assessment and Capacity Building:</h2>
      <p>Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): Jointly conducted by the LDR DRR Unit, DM sector, and IOM with shelter managers and focal points in Tyre and Hasbaya, these sessions assessed training needs for shelter management personnel.</p>
      <p>The insights gathered from these FGDs were used to design a comprehensive training program that effectively addresses identified gaps in knowledge and skills.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Training Development and Delivery:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Training of Trainers (TOT) Program: The LRC DRR and DM units collaborated with IOM and DRC to develop and deliver a shelter and collective site coordinators capacity-building training program for trainers from various organizations. Attendees were from the following agencies/organizations: DRR LRC, DM LRC, DRMU, IOM, DRC, Near East Foundation, NRC and Acted.</li>
        <li>LRC Internal Training: The LRC successfully conducted an internal Applied Training Course (ATC) on shelters and collective sites coordination for its volunteers. These trained trainers are now equipped and had been delivering this vital training to local communities and relevant stakeholders at the subnational level.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Looking Forward:</h2>
      <p>The collaborative efforts of the LDR DRR Unit, LRC, IOM, and other stakeholders have laid a strong foundation for effective shelter management during emergencies. The comprehensive guidance document and the established training program will significantly enhance the capacity of local communities and shelter management personnel to respond efficiently in times of need. This collaborative approach to preparedness ensures a more coordinated and effective response to future emergencies.</p>
